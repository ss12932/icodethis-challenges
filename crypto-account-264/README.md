## Elaborations

I thoroughly enjoyed my first icodethis challenge, It was relatively straightforward given I haven't done vanilla projects in a while. Initially, I did not know where to start and just began coding away with HTML and styling mixed in. I think the best course of action is to completely construct the HTML skeleton for everything first before attempting any sort of styling. I attempted the challenge with only HTML and tailwindCSS but I could of used javascript to reduce amount of duplicate boilerplate which will be part of my future refactoring of this challenge. Some minor issues with the responsiveness but after tinkering with the utility classes for a while, I managed to fixed the responsiveness and vertical overflow issues with the transaction container. This could end up as a functional application with send/receive, add account etc but decided I only wanted to spend 1 hour at most practicing my tailwind. Again, will be part of my future refactorings. I really enjoyed the challenge and learned alot using tailwind's utility classes.
